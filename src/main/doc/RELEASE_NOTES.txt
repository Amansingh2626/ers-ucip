    Before it was only possible to cut all but the X last digits

    Now it is also possible to use msisdn_strip_prefixes to strip
    away the country code from the incomign E.164 formatted number.

    does not cause getAccountInformation to fail, instead it will return 
    successfull but set the account status to Pending in the response.
    IMPORTANT! This could cause some transactions that previously failed 
    to succeed, so if there is any business logic that depends on this 
    (incorrect) behaviour it might allow transactions that should not 
    succeed to go through.
    Also added support for configurable per-product rules to enable 
    validation of topups depending on product SKU.
