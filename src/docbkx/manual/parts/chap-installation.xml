	<section>
		<title>Starting/stopping the UCIPLink system
		</title>
		<para>
			To be able to manage the application you need to have the
			standard ERS environment set up. The easiest way is to source /opt/seamless/etc/env/env.conf in ~/.bashrc.
		</para>
		<para>
			To manage the application you use the <command>uciplink</command> command
			as user admin or the <command>/etc/init.d/uciplink</command> as user root..
		</para>
		<example>
			<title>Example starting the UCIPLink system</title>
			<programlisting>
admin@localhost:~> uciplink start
Starting uciplink...OK (PID: 22163)</programlisting>
		</example>
		<example>
			<title>Example stopping the UCIPLink system</title>
			<programlisting>
admin@localhost:~> uciplink stop
Stopping uciplink...OK</programlisting>
		</example>
		<example>
			<title>Checking the UCIPLink system status</title>
			<programlisting>
admin@localhost:~> uciplink status
uciplink is running (PID: 22163)</programlisting>
		</example>
		<example>
			<title>Restarting the UCIPLink system</title>

	<section>
		<title>Graceful shutdown</title>
		<para>	
			Graceful shutdown is supported with help of the Seamless ServiceManager component that integrates with the
			StandardFlowControlHandler and SimpleServletServer components.
		</para>
		<para>
			The ServiceManager is hooked up into the JVM at startup to be able to handle situations when the server is terminated 
			externally, for example with SIGKILL signal on Unix.
		</para>
		<para>
			At shutdown the server will reject any new incoming call to the StandardFlowControlHandler and send a message back to the client. To avoid loss of data
			all ongoing tasks managed by the StandardFlowControlHandler will be timed out, and last the server will be ended.
		</para>
		<para>
			There is a timeout value that can be configured in the application property file that generates a warning message in the log if not all resources was released within the given timeout,
			that can be used to identify if there are unexpected long running tasks.
		</para>
